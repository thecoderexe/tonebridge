**tonebridge** was built with the idea that translation shouldn't be one-size-fits-all.  

The goal is to provide:
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Customizable, context-aware translation** with adjustable tone and formality
- üîä **Optional voice playback** using ElevenLabs or native speech synthesis
- üé® A clean, modern UI with support for multiple themes

It‚Äôs designed to help developers prototype better multilingual interactions in their own tools or apps‚Äîwithout the complexity.
